### ***Spam Email Classification***

*This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating a basic email spam/ham classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The goal of this project is to build a classifier that can distinguish between spam and legitimate (ham) emails.*

### ***Dataset***

*The dataset used for this classification task consists of email messages and their corresponding labels (spam or ham). Each email is represented as a text string, and the labels are binary, where:*

*1: Email is classified as spam*

*0: Email is classified as ham (non-spam)*

### ***Algorithm Used***

*For this classification task, I employed the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. SVM is a powerful supervised learning method that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. In this scenario, I trained the SVM model to classify emails as spam or ham based on the textual content.*

### ***Results***

*The model demonstrated high precision and recall for classifying ham (non-spam) emails, with an accuracy of 94% on the test dataset. However, the recall for classifying spam emails was comparatively lower, indicating some room for improvement.*

#### ***Happy classifying!***
